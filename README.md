# Event-MasterPage
Aim:- Design online registration form for the participation of technical events (use HTML  Controls, validation controls) and display all the data on the other page. Also design a layout  using Master Page. 

Note : We cannot add two content pages at the same time. We can add more than one  contentplaceholder control in the master page and all the contents for those controls are  defined in single content page.
